    <h5 style="font-size:21px;color:white">Demonetisation</h5>
    <p>On 8 November 2016,the government of India announced the demonetisation of all 500 and 1000 banknotes of Mahatma Gandhi Series.It also announced the issuance of new 500 and 2000 banknotes in exchange for the demonetised banknotes.The government claimed that the action would curtail the shadow economy and reduce the use of illicit and counterfeit cash to fund illegal activity and terrorism.</p>
The announcement of demonetisation was followed by prolonged cash shortages in the weeks that followed,which created significant disruption throughout the economy.People seeking to exchange their banknotes had to stand in lengthy queues,and several deaths were linked to the rush to exchange cash.</p>
According to a 2018 report from the Reserve Bank of India,approximately 99.3% of the demonetised banknotes,or 15.30lakh crore of the 15.41 lakh crore that had been demonetised, were deposited with the banking system.The banknotes that were not deposited were only worth 10,720 crore(107.2 billion),leading analysis to state that the effort had failed to remove black money from the economy.
The BSE SENSEX and NIFTY 50 stock indices fell over 6 percent on the day after the announcement.The move reduced the country's industrial production and its GDP growth rate.
Initially, the move recieved support from several bankers as well as from some international commentators.The move was also criticised as poorly planned and unfair, and was met with protests,litigation, and strikes against the government in several places across India.Debates also took place concerning the move in both houses of parlament[17][18][19][20].</p>
